# 🌤️ Weather Meter

A Python-based utility designed to fetch, log, and analyze real-time meteorological data. 

**Weather Meter** automates the collection of atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) from standard weather APIs, making it easy to build datasets for local climate monitoring and data science projects.

## ✨ Features
* **Real-Time Data Fetching:** Retrieves live weather metrics using [OpenWeatherMap API / WeatherAPI].
* **Automated Logging:** Saves data at scheduled intervals into structured formats (CSV/JSON) for easy analysis.
* **Data Visualization (Optional):** Generates graphs to track temperature and humidity trends over time.
* **Lightweight & Fast:** Optimized Python script that can run seamlessly in the background or on a low-resource machine like a Raspberry Pi.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** `requests` (API calls), `pandas` (data manipulation), `matplotlib` (data visualization), `schedule` (automation)

## 🚀 Getting Started
